This C# WPF calculator is designed to replicate the standard Windows 11 basic calculator with nearly a 1-to-1 layout, sizing, and colors. While most functionality is identical, some preferential changes have been made.

It includes the following features:

<pre>
MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS:
Add: takes the sum of the current and previous values
Subtract: takes the difference of the current and previous values
Multiply: takes the product of the current and previous values
Divide: takes the quotient of the current and previous values
Square: squares the current value
Square Root: takes the square root of the current value
Reciprocal: takes the inverse of the current value
Percent: divides the current value by 100
Sign Change: changes the sign of the current value (positive/negative)
</pre>

<pre>
CALCULATOR OPERATIONS:
Numpad: includes a numeric value 0-9
Decimal Point: includes a decimal point
Clear Entry: clears the current value
Clear: clears all values
Delete: clears the rightmost character
Equals: displays the operation result
</pre>
<pre>
COLOR THEME:
The color theme of the calculator can be switched between Windows light (default)
and dark themes.
</pre>
<pre>
CONTINUOUS OPERATION:
Continuous operation is supported, which means that there is no need to press
"equals" between calculations. Additional operations will automatically complete
previous operations before continuing.
</pre>
<pre>
KEYBOARD INPUT:
In addition to clicking the calculator buttons, keyboard input is also supported
for non-numpad keys: 0-9, ., +, -, *, /, %, =, Enter, Backspace, and Delete.
</pre>
<pre>
VALIDATION:
The calculator has been designed to validate every input scenario. Examples include:
- The square root button will have no effect on a negative value.
- If the current value is only a decimal point, operations will not be executed.
- If the current value is zero and a number key is pressed, the 0 will be replaced
  by the number rather than added to it. For example, pressing "5" will display "5"
  instead of "05".
- Only relevant keyboard buttons will have an effect on the calculator input.
